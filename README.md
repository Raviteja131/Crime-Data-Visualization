Project Description: Crime Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focuses on analyzing crime data using Python and data visualization libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in crime activity based on various factors such as time of day, day of the week, district, and type of crime.

Key Analysis and Visualizations:
Peak Hours of Crime:

A heatmap is generated to visualize the distribution of the top 10 most frequent crime types across different hours of the day. This helps in identifying peak hours for different crimes.
Crime Frequency on Weekends and Weekdays:

A bar plot visualizes the frequency of selected crimes (e.g., Larceny, Vandalism, Robbery) across the days of the week. The comparison highlights differences between weekend and weekday crime activity.
Crime Group Frequency by District:

A count plot illustrates the most common crime types in each district. This analysis helps in understanding which crime groups are more prevalent in certain areas.
Crime Rate by District:

The overall crime rates are plotted by district to give a sense of where crimes are concentrated within the city.
Crime Rate Trend Over the Years:

A line plot shows the overall trend in crime rates over multiple years. This visual highlights whether crime rates are increasing or decreasing over time.
Crime Rate by Month:

A bar plot visualizes the monthly crime frequency to uncover seasonal variations in crime activity.
Shooting Trends:

A specific analysis is done for incidents involving shootings. The number of shooting incidents per year is plotted, revealing trends in gun-related crimes over time.
Data Source:
The project works with a dataset containing various attributes related to criminal activities such as offense type, time, location (district), day of the week, month, year, and whether shootings were involved.

Tools Used:
Pandas for data manipulation.
Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating visualizations and plots.
Pivot tables for reshaping the data in preparation for heatmaps.
This project provides insightful visualizations that can aid law enforcement agencies, city planners, and researchers in understanding crime patterns and identifying areas for intervention and policy formulation.
